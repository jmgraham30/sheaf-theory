\chapter{Solutions to the exercises at the end of Chapter 1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Prove that the~$\varinjlim$ of the direct systems of the examples is~$F(\emptyset)$ in each case. Generalise.

    \begin{solution}
      The direct system of a topology corresponds to a complete lattice, hence there is a minimum and a maximum: $\emptyset$ and~$X$. The direct limit now corresponds to `the object that goes to the right of everything' but in this case,~$\emptyset$ is on the right over everything, therefore, the direct limit is given by~$F(\emptyset)$.
    \end{solution}

  \item Prove directly from the definitions that if~$U$ is a direct limit of a direct system~$(U_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\Lambda}$ of sets, then~$U=\bigcup_{\alpha\in\Lambda}\Image(U_\alpha\rightarrow U)$.

    \begin{solution}
      The~$\rho_{\alpha,\beta}$ in the definition of a target are injective maps. Now the set~$\coprod_{\alpha\in\Lambda}U_\alpha$ is a possible target, with~$\sigma_\alpha$ mapping an element to all positions in the disjoint union such that it is contained in the corresponding set~$U_\gamma$.

      By the definition of the direct limit, there must be a unique~$f$ to this target, making the triangle commute. But as I'm writing this, it feels like a reformulation of Theorem~3.10.
    \end{solution}

  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Interpret and prove: a set is the direct limit of its finite subsets.
      
        \begin{solution}
          The construction of the direct limit consists of quotienting the disjoint union. All elements of the set~$U$ are represented in a finite subset (for instance the singletons), so the disjoint union contains all elements. Elements are now identified if they are identified in the power set lattice of~$U$, but as the union of two finite subsets is still finite the identification of an element~$v\in U_\alpha,U_\beta$ occurs in~$U_\gamma=U_\alpha\cup U_\beta$.
        \end{solution}

      \item Interpret and prove: an abelian group is the direct limit of iets finitely generated subgroups.

        \begin{solution}
          Analogously, finitely generated subgroups are represented in the same kind of lattice structure with atoms and finite unions of generators. 
        \end{solution}

      \item Can you obtain~$\mathbb{Z}$ as a direct limit of finite abelian groups?

        \begin{solution}
          No, only torsion groups are obtainable. As finite abelian groups are all isomorphic to products of~$\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ and we'll be taking a quotient from a direct sum, all elements will keep their finite order.
        \end{solution}
    \end{enumerate}

  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Characterise direct systems of sets with~$\varinjlim=\emptyset$.

        \begin{solution}
          TODO
        \end{solution}

      \item Produce an interesting direct system of abelian groups with~$\varinjlim=\left\{ 0 \right\}$, the trivial group. Characterise such systems.

        \begin{solution}
          TODO
        \end{solution}
    \end{enumerate}

  \item What can you say about the direct limit of a direct system all of whose maps are injective? Surjective?

    \begin{solution}
      All the maps to the direct limit are injective (or surjective). In the injective case the direct limit contains information on~\emph{all} objects of the direct system, in the surjective case the direct limit contains the~\emph{common} information of all objects.
    \end{solution}

  \item For~$n\in\mathbb{N}_0$, let~$C_n(x)$ denote a cyclic group of order~$n$ with generator~$x$. Let~$p\in\mathbb{N}$ be a prime number. Let~$G$ be the direct limit of the following direct system of abelian groups:
    \begin{equation}
      \left\{ 0 \right\}=C_{p^0}(x_0)\rightarrow C_{p^1}(x_1)\rightarrow\ldots\rightarrow C_{p^n}(x_n)\rightarrow C_{p^{n+1}}(x_{n+1})\rightarrow\ldots
    \end{equation}
    (where~$C_{p^n}(x_n)\rightarrow C_{p^{n+1}}(x_{n+1})$ takes~$x_n\mapsto px_{n+1}$). Preferably without resorting to the explicit construction prove:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $G$ is infinite, but torsion (\ie~element has finite order).

        \begin{solution}
          Based on the previous exercise we realize that~$G$ is a big structure as every map is injective. As every step in the chain adds a finite number of elements and there are countable steps, we obtain a countable infinite group.

          As the construction of the direct limit consists of summing all objects of the direct system and taking a quotient, we get that every element of the direct sum has finite order (namely the order of the highest term) and the quotient keeps this structure.
        \end{solution}

      \item Every finitely-generated subgroup of~$G$ is finite. Find all of them.

        \begin{solution}
          Every finite set of generators has a maximal index~$n$ such that the term for~$C_{p^n}$ is nonzero but for~$C_{p^{n+1}}$ is zero. The order of the finitely-generated subgroup is now limited by the order~$p^n$.
        \end{solution}
    \end{enumerate}

    Deduce that~$G$ has no proper infinite subgroup, and no maximal proper subgroup. Can either of these situations arise for subspaces of a vector space (using dimension instead of order)? Identify a realisation of~$G$ inside the unit circle~$S^1\subseteq\mathbb{C}$ (under multiplication).

    \begin{solution}
      The construction of the direct sum learns us that there must be an infinite number of nonzero summands, but as every~$C_{p^n}$ is trivially embedded in~$C_{p^m}$ for all~$m>n$ and every such instance is identified we cannot get to a proper infinite subgroup. Analogously there is no maximal proper subgroup.

      The only interesting case occurs in infinite-dimensional vector spaces, the finite-dimensional case is trivial (take the quotient of the space with the field).

      The obtained structure is the Pr\"ufer group.
    \end{solution}

  \item Consider the following direct system of abelian groups: fix~$r\in\mathbb{Z}$; for all~$n\in\mathbb{N}$ let~$U_n=\mathbb{Z}$ and for~$n\geq m$ let~$\rho_{m,n}\colon U_m\to U_n$ be multiplication by~$r^{n-m}$. Identify the~$\varinjlim$ as a subring of~$\mathbb{Q}$.

    \begin{solution}
      This is the localization at the ideal generated by~$r$. In the case of~$r$ prime this is~$\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$, in the other case we obtain all fractions with prime factors of~$r$ as denominators.
    \end{solution}

  \item Interpret and prove: the direct limit of a system of exact sequences is exact.

    \begin{solution}
      For~$0\to A_n\to B_n\to C_n\to 0$ an exact sequence all the maps described in the definition of a direct limit are commuting by the properties of injective and surjective maps.
    \end{solution}

  \item The notions of target and direct limit can be formulated without the restriction (a) of Definitions~3.1 and~3.11. What difference does this make to the constructions? Find a system of abelian groups (in this generalised sense) with direct limit~$A\oplus B$ without having this abelian group appear in the system. Justify Remark~3.21.

    \begin{solution}
      TODO
    \end{solution}

  \item Formulate the dual notions of inverse system and inverse limit~$\varprojlim$ (reverse the arrows).

    \begin{solution}
      As the exercise suggests, this is just a reversal of the arrows~$\rho_{\alpha,\beta}$ to~$U_\beta\to U_\alpha$, for~$\alpha\leq\beta$.
    \end{solution}
    
    Find inverse systems:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item of finite sets whose~$\varprojlim$ is infinite;

        \begin{solution}
          Take~$(\mathbb{N},\leq)$ and define~$A_k=\left\{ 0,\ldots,k \right\}$. We get~$\rho_{i,j}\colon A_j\to A_i$ the projection for~$i\leq j$. The direct limit is the set~$\mathbb{N}$.
        \end{solution}

      \item of finite abelian groups whose~$\varprojlim$ is infinite;

        \begin{solution}
          The ring of $p$\nobreakdash-adic integers~$\mathbb{Z}_p$ is given by~$\varprojlim\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$.
        \end{solution}

      \item of abelian groups whose~$\varprojlim$ is~$\mathbb{Z}$ (without~$\mathbb{Z}$ in the system).

        \begin{solution}
          Start from~$\mathbb{Q}$. Let~$p_n$ denote the~$n$th prime number. Now define~$G_k$ to be the subgroup of~$\mathbb{Q}$ in which all primes but~$p_1,\ldots,p_n$ are allowed as factors of the denumerator. The morphisms are the injections. Now~$\mathbb{Z}$ is the inverse limit, it being the subgroup of~$\mathbb{Q}$ in which all prime factors of denumerators are removed.
        \end{solution}
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Verify that if~$(R_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\Lambda}$ is a direct system of abelian groups such that each~$R_\alpha$ is a ring and all the~$\rho_{\alpha,\beta}$ are ring morphisms, then~$\varinjlim R_\alpha$ has a natural ring structure such that all the maps~$R_\beta\to\varinjlim R_\alpha$ are ring morphisms.

    \begin{solution}
      The ring structure is preserved by the direct sum construction of the direct limit of abelian groups. As the subgroup~$H_1$ is the construction is an ideal because the multiplicative structure is preserved by the injections, we obtain a quotient ring.
    \end{solution}

  \item What are the stalks of the presheaf~$P_2$ of~2.E?

    \begin{solution}
      We have~$(P_2)_{x_0}=\mathbb{Z}$ as every open subset~$U$ containing~$x_0$ has~$P_2(U)=\mathbb{Z}$, with~$\rho_{\alpha,\beta}=\identity_{\mathbb{Z}}$ in the direct system.

      For~$(P_2)_{x}$ with~$x\neq x_0$ we get~$\left\{ 0 \right\}$, the trivial group. We have~$|x-x_0|=\epsilon>0$, so for the open set~$B(x,\epsilon)\cap[0,1]$ the presheaf gives~$\left\{ 0 \right\}$, all values of the presheaf from there on are the same trivial group.
    \end{solution}

  \item Construct a topological space~$X$ and a presheaf~$F$ of abelian groups on~$X$ with the properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item for any open~$U\subseteq X$: $F(U)\neq\left\{ 0 \right\}$;
      \item for all~$x\in X$ the stalk~$F_x=\left\{ 0 \right\}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    If you cannot, prove that it is impossible. Compare with~4(b).

    \begin{solution}
      An interesting case with non-abelian groups would be to take the space~$X=[0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q}$ and assign to an open subset~$U$ the permutation on its elements. The direct limit is now the permutation on a single element, hence the trivial group.

\chapter{Solutions to the exercises in Chapter 2}
\begin{exercise}[1.9]
  Show that if~$G$ is an abelian sheaf, then~$G(\emptyset)=\left\{ 0 \right\}$, the trivial group.

  \begin{solution}
    By taking the empty cover of the empty set, the first part of the sequence that corresponds to the equalizer diagram reduces to
    \begin{equation}
      0\to G(\emptyset)\to 0
    \end{equation}
    because we're taking the product over an empty set ($\Gamma=\emptyset$). Now~$G(\emptyset)$ is embedded in~$0$, and must therefore be equal to the trivial group.
  \end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[1.12]
  Find an example with~$G$ not a monopresheaf where~1.10 fails.

  \begin{solution}
    Take both~$F$ and~$G$ the presheaf~$P_1$ from~Example~1.2.E. Now define~$f\colon F\to G$ to be the trivial map for~$F(U)\to G(U)$,~$U\neq X$ open and let~$f(X)\colon F(X)\to G(X):n\mapsto 2n$. Similarly,~$g(X)\colon F(X)\to G(X):n\mapsto 3n$. Now~$f$ and~$g$ agree on all stalks but as the monopresheaf fails (all restrictions are elements of the trivial group but the global behaviour differs) we have~$f\neq g$.
  \end{solution}

\chapter{Solutions to the exercises at the end of Chapter 2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let~$I=[0,1]\hookrightarrow\mathbb{R}$. Show that there is a unique (up to isomorphism) sheaf~$F$ on~$I$ with stalks: $F_0=F_1=\mathbb{Z}$, $F_x=\left\{ 0 \right\}$ if~$x\in I\setminus\left\{ 0,1 \right\}$.

    \begin{solution}
      TODO
    \end{solution}

    What is~$\Shf(I, F)$?

    \begin{solution}
      It is~$\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}$, as it is composed of contributions of the stalks in~$0$ and~$1$.
    \end{solution}

    Let~$G$ be the constant sheaf~$\mathbb{Z}$ on~$I$. How many morphisms are there from~$F$ to~$G$? From~$G$ to~$F$?

    \begin{solution}
      TODO
    \end{solution}

  \item Show that the following conditions are equivalent for a topological space~$X$:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item\label{exercise:2-2-a} $X$ is locally connected (that is, each point has a base of connected neighbourhoods);
      \item\label{exercise:2-2-b} for any set~$A$, the constant sheaf~$A_X$ has~$\Gamma(U,A_X)=\prod_{t\in U'}A$ for~$U$ open in~$A$ where~$U'$ is the set of connected components of~$U$;
      \item\label{exercise:2-2-c} $\ref{exercise:2-2-b}$ holds for~$A=\left\{ 0,1 \right\}$, some set with two elements.
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{solution}
      \begin{description}
        \item[$\ref{exercise:2-2-a}\Rightarrow\ref{exercise:2-2-b}$] We have that
          \begin{equation}
            \sections(U,A_X)=\left\{ \text{locally constant functions~$U\to A$} \right\}
          \end{equation}
          and as any covering of~$U$ falls apart in disjoint coverings of every connected component of~$U$ we obtain~$\prod_{t\in U'}A$.
        \item[$\ref{exercise:2-2-b}\Rightarrow\ref{exercise:2-2-c}$] Trivial specialization.
        \item[$\ref{exercise:2-2-c}\Rightarrow\ref{exercise:2-2-a}$] As~$\sections(U,\left\{ 0,1 \right\}_X)=\prod_{t\in U'}\left\{ 0,1 \right\}$ we obtain a notion of indicator functions. They determine uniquely to which connected components an open subset of~$U$ belongs.
      \end{description}
    \end{solution}

    When these conditions hold, what are the restriction maps in terms of the representation given in~$\ref{exercise:2-2-b}$?

    \begin{solution}
      The restrictions are projections on the remaining components. For~$V\subseteq U$ open we have the inclusion~$V'\subseteq U'$ of sets of connected components.
    \end{solution}

  \item Let~$F$ be a presheaf on a space~$X$, and let~$V$ be open in~$X$. Then we can define a presheaf~$F|_V$ on~$V$ by the same recipe as~$F$; that is~$(F|_V)(U)=F(U)$ for~$U$ open in~$V$.

    Show that is~$F$ is a sheaf, so is~$F|_V$.

    \begin{solution}
      Intersecting an open covering with an open set~$V$ leads to an open covering of this set in~$V$ \emph{in the topology on~$X$}. Now the conditions for the sheaf on~$V$ trivially hold because they hold in~$X$.
    \end{solution}

    Show also that if~$F$ has sheaf space~$p\colon \ShfSpace(F)\to X$, then~$F|_V$ has sheaf space $(p^{-1}(V),p|_{p^{-1}(V)})$. What can you say when~$V$ is not open?

    \begin{solution}
      The projection map~$p$ must be restricted to~$p^{-1}(V)$ as the corresponding sheaf acts on~$V$. Now Lemma~3.5(b) provides the necessary conditions, as intersections of open sets are open.
    \end{solution}

    Compare Exercise~\ref{exercise:2-4} and~\P3.8.

    \begin{solution}
      TODO
    \end{solution}

  \item\label{exercise:2-4} Let~$F$ be a sheaf on a space~$X$ with sheaf space~$\ShfSpace(F)\overset{p}{\rightarrow} X$, and let~$A$ be a subspace of~$X$. We ca define the set (or abelian group) of sections of~$F$ over~$A$ by
    \begin{align}
      \sections(A,F)&=\sections(A,\Shf(F)) \\
      &=\left\{ \text{sections of the continuous map $p^{-1}(A)\overset{p}{\rightarrow}A$} \right\}.
    \end{align}
    Show that we can define~$\sections(A,F)$ in terms of~$F$ alone as~$\sections(A,F)=\varinjlim\sections(U,F)$ where the direct limit is taken over the set of open subsets~$U$ of~$X$ such that~$U\supseteq A$. (Colloquially, this says that a section of~$F$ over~$A$ extends uniquely into a small neighbourhood of~$A$.)

    \begin{solution}
      A section over~$A$ is a section for~$p\colon p^{-1}(A)\to A$, but continuity is defined in terms of \emph{open sets}, so every section over~$A$ must be a section for some~$U\supseteq A$. By taking the direct limit we identify equal sections.
    \end{solution}

  \item\label{exercise:2-5} Let~$F$ be a sheaf on a space~$X$ and let~$(M_i)_{i\in I}$ be a locally finite covering of~$X$ by closed sets (so that for each~$x\in X$, $\left\{ i\in I\,|\,x\in M_i \right\}$ is finite). In the notation of~\ref{exercise:2-4}, suppose we are given a family~$(s_i)_{i\in I}$ with~$\forall i\in I\colon s_i\in\sections(M_i,F)$ and~$\forall i,j\in I\colon s_i=s_j$ on~$M_i\cap M_j$.

    Show that there is a unique~$s\in\sections(X,F)$ with~$\forall i\in I\colon s=s_i$ on~$M_i$.

    \begin{solution}
      By the previous exercise all sections on a closed~$M_i$ are lifted uniquely to a small (open) neigbhourhood. We can apply the necessary conditions on these sets and restrict.
    \end{solution}

  \item Let~$K$ be any infinite field and~$L=K(t)$ a simple transcendental extension. Let~$X$ be the topological space obtained by giving~$K$ the topology whose closed sets are the finite subsets of~$K$.

    Define a sheaf~$\mathcal{O}$ of commutative unital rings on~$X$ as follows: for~$U$ open in~$X$, $U\neq\emptyset$, let
    \begin{equation}
      \mathcal{O}(U)=\left\{ f\in L\,\middle|\,\exists g,h\in K[t]\colon f=\frac{g}{h}\vee\forall P\in U\colon h(P)\neq 0 \right\}.
      \label{equation:rational-functions}
    \end{equation}

    If~$\emptyset\neq V\subseteq U$ then~$\mathcal{O}(U)\subseteq\mathcal{O}(V)\subseteq L$ and we take the inclusion as the restriction map~$\rho_V^U$. Show that~$\mathcal{O}$ is a sheaf of rings on~$X$.

    \begin{solution}
      As~$X$ is equipped with the cofinite topology, it is compact. Now every open covering reduces to a finite covering. Now the conditions for a sheaf are fulfilled: to every open set we've assigned an algebra, restrictions are correct and the glueing conditions reduces to an argument on the poles of the section (when considered over~$X$).
    \end{solution}

    Identify the stalk~$\mathcal{O}_P$ of~$\mathcal{O}$ at~$P\in X$ as a subring of~$L$ and show that it is a local ring. What is its residue field and its field of fractions?

    \begin{solution}
      The stalk corresponds to
      \begin{equation}
        \mathcal{O}_P=\left\{ f\in L\,\middle|\,\exists g,h\in K[t]\colon f=\frac{g}{h}\wedge h(P)\neq 0 \right\}.
      \end{equation}
      Now the ideal of~$f$ such that~$f(P)=0$ is the unique maximal ideal because the functions for which~$f(P)\neq 0$ are invertible, hence not part of any maximal ideal. The quotient gives a residue field, which is an extension field of~$K$. The corresponding field of fractions TODO
    \end{solution}

    When does~$\mathcal{O}$ have non-polynomial global sections? That is, we certainly have~$K[t]\subseteq\sections(X,\mathcal{O})$; when is the equality strict?

    \begin{solution}
      When~$K$ is not algebraically closed, there are polynomials~$h\in K[t]$ such that~$h(P)\neq 0$ for all~$P\in X$. For instance~$t^2+1$ in~$\mathbb{R}[t]$ provides a good denominator for non-polynomial global sections.

      This is an equivalence: a non-polynomial global section must consist of a fraction of polynomials (exactly by the definition of the sections), so its denominator cannot have a zero. This only occurs when~$K$ is not algebraically closed (otherwise the denominator factors into linear components).
    \end{solution}

    We can consider~$f\in\sections(U,\mathcal{O})$ as a function on~$U$, namely express~$f=g/h$ as in~\eqref{equation:rational-functions} and define for~$P\in U$
    \begin{equation}
      f(P)=g(P)/h(P)\in K.
    \end{equation}
    Show that this defines a morphism~$\phi\colon\mathcal{O}\to F$ where~$F$ is the sheaf of~$K$\nobreakdash-valued functions on~$X$ (giving~$K$ the indiscrete topology), and that putting~$\mathcal{O}'(U)=\Image\left( \phi(U) \right)$ defines a sheaf~$\mathcal{O}'$ with a morphism~$\mathcal{O}\to\mathcal{O}'$. Prove that~$\mathcal{O}\to\mathcal{O}'$ is an isomorphism of sheaves. Hence we may regard~$\mathcal{O}$ as a sheaf of~$K$\nobreakdash-valued functions on~$X$.

    \begin{solution}
      TODO
    \end{solution}

    For~$K=\mathbb{C}$ show that~$\mathcal{O}'$ is a subsheaf of the sheaf~$\mathbb{C}^\omega$ of analytic~$\mathbb{C}$\nobreakdash-valued functions on~$X=\mathbb{C}$.

  \item Let~$P$ be the category of pointed sets, whose objects are the pairs~$(A,a)$ with~$a\in A\in\Ob(\Sets)$, and whose morphisms $(A,a)\to(B,b)$ are the maps of sets~$f\colon A\to B$ such that~$f(a)=b$. Show that~$P$ is a category with a zero object, kernels and cokernels, but in which not every epimorphism is a cokernel.

    \begin{solution}
      Every singleton set~$(\left\{ x \right\},x)$ is a zero object. The initial object~$\emptyset$ from~$\Sets$ is now changed to~$(\left( x \right),x)$ as every morphism needs to map the base point. The terminal object~$\left\{ x \right\}$ in~$\Sets$ remains unchanged as it allows for exactly one morphism (which preserves the base point).

      For kernels and cokernels we need a zero morphism, which in this case is the projection on the base point. For~$f\colon(A,a)\to(B,b)$ we have~$\Ker(f)=(f^{-1}(b),a)$ and~$\Coker(f)=(f(A),b)$.

  \item A sheaf~$F$ of abelian groups on~$X$ is called \emph{locally free} if and only if each point~$x\in X$ has an open neighbourhood~$U$ in~$X$ such that the sheaf~$F|_U$ is isomorphic to a constant sheaf with typical stalk a free abelian group (of finite rank). Show that if~$X$ is connected, a locally free sheaf has a well-defined rank.

    Show by example that a locally free sheaf on~$X$ need not be isomorphic to a constant sheaf even if~$X$ is connected, and that~$\phi_*$ does not preserve the property of being locally free.

      Take~$X=\left\{ 0,1,2 \right\}$ with topology~$\mathcal{T}=\left\{ \left\{ 0,1 \right\},\left\{ 1 \right\},\left\{ 1,2 \right\},X \right\}$ and define~$F$ to be the sheaf with sections
      \begin{align}
